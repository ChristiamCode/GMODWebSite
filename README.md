# About
<html>
	This repository will have some content needed for external stuff(like loading screens, images) and won't be very major. Currently, all the displayed content on my server is located in the "docs" directory. The repository's content will be needed for a Garry's Mod server which you can find here: 69.115.25.109.

# Rules
<html>
	<ul>
		<li>Do not make unwanted changes</li>
		<li>Ask before you change something, the content for a public server on Garry's Mod</li>
		<li>Post any suggestions or potential issues</li>
		<li>Make constructive changes</li>
	</ul>
